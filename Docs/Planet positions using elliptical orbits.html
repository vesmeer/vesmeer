<h2><a name="twig01">Overview</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>You can calculate the position of one of the major planets to
within an accuracy of one arc minute on the sky using an
ordinary
scientific calculator in about 20 minutes. 

</p><p>You will need the current 'osculating elements' for the
elliptical orbit of the planet and for the Earth. Osculating
elements allow for the effects of the mutual interactions of the
planets for a given date, and positions calculated from a given
set of elements will be less accurate further from that date.
The
advantage is in conceptual simplicity - you are using a simple
2-
body model of an orbit, with the Sun at one focus.

</p><p>I shall calculate the position of Mars as an example, and the
positions will be within a few arc minutes of the correct
positions for about a year either side of the date of the
elements used.

</p><p>You might want to find a position 'by hand' once, so as to
understand the calculation method and get a feel for the size of
the numbers involved. After that, it is fairly easy to write a
simple program for a programmable calculator, or devise a
spreadsheet. A very simple <code>QBASIC</code> program is given
below.

</p><p>The image of an elliptical orbit moving under Kepler's laws
seems so simple that we forget how confused and difficult the
development of this idea was. To mention just one detail - in
the
period after Kepler and before Newton, there was no good theory
of atmospheric refraction, so that reported positions of the
planets had systematic errors which depended on the angle above
the horizon at which the observations were made. Observations
would not fit ellipses in a consistent way, and Kepler, Horrocks
and Streete (to name a few) struggled with 'anomalies' in the
sense of Kuhn [Kuhn 1962]. 

</p><h2><a name="twig01a">Frameworks and coordinates</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>The positions of objects in the sky as viewed from Earth are
referred to a coordinate system whose alignment is changing with
time in a complex way. A few of the important motions and
effects are summarised below;

</p><ul>
<li>The Earth is rotating on its axis once every siderial day
</li><li>The rotation axis is moving in a circle with a period of
roughly 26,000 years (precession)
</li><li>The axis is 'nodding' up and down with a period of roughly
19
years (nutation)
</li><li>The finite speed of light (sometimes referred to as
'aberration' in some books)
</li></ul>

<p>The 'fixed' stars provide a reference system which allows us
to account for the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. We
use the Equatorial coordinate system to refer positions to a
frame in which the stars appear still, and the right ascension
(RA) and declination (DEC) are used to give the coordinates of
the planet with respect to the fixed stars. The 'zero' of RA is
refered to the 'vernal equinox', in the same way that the 'zero'
of longitude is taken as the Greenwich Meridian.

</p><p>The presession of the equinoxes means that the 'zero' of RA
is changing slowly with time, which means that star coordinates
must always be referred to an epoch, or date. By using
orbital elements referred to the fundamental epoch J2000, the
orbits of the planets are described in a coordinate system which
is based on the position the vernal equinox <em>will have</em>
at J2000. A further advantage of this dodge is that our
positions for the planets will correspond exactly to the
positions found in most recent star charts. You should be able
to plot the path of Mars directly onto a star chart such as
<cite>The Cambridge Star Atlas</cite>.

</p><p>Nutation (which is a small effect anyway) can also be
spirited away by referring our positions to the 'mean ecliptic
of J2000'. The word 'mean' indicates that no allowance for
nutation has been made. Our observation platform (the Earth) is
nodding, so the stars and planets will appear to nod together.
Our J2000 elements will give is positions which match the
co-ordinates of the stars found in star maps.

</p><p>There is a problem with this use of J2000 equinox and mean
ecliptic. If I just dial the values for RA and DEC into a
computerised telescope, then the planet will <em>not</em> appear
in the centre of the field of view - as the RA and DEC will not
be referred to the 'equinox and true ecliptic of date'. The
effect will be very small for 10 years either side of J2000.

</p><p>A larger effect with the outlying planets will be caused by
the finite speed of light. Indeed, one of the first estimates of
the speed of light was obtained by careful timings of the
eclipses of the Galilean moons of Jupiter. Light takes about 50
minutes to reach us from Jupiter, and so we see Jupiter in a
position it was about 50 minutes before we looked! The problem
is that we don't know how far Jupiter is until we calculate the
planet's position, but we can't calculate the position
accurately until we allow for the light travel time.... A series
of approximations is needed. A position which has been corrected
for the light travel time and which is referred to equinox and
mean ecliptic of J2000 is called 'astrometric'. I shall be
adding corrections for this later.

</p><p> There are approximate and accurate formulas for converting
positions at one time to positions at another [Duffett-Smith
section 34, 35] [Meeus, Chapter 20, 21]. 

</p><p>For more information on frames and rectangular coordinates,
including some rather nice diagrams, see;

</p><h2><a name="twig02">The osculating elements</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>An elliptical orbit can be specified by the values of various
numbers. The plane of the orbit must be specified, as must the
size and the eccentricity, and the position of the perihelion,
and the position of the planet at the date of the elements.
There
are a number of different sets of numbers which can be used, and
one set can be converted into another set. The Astronomical
Almanac provides 7 numbers to specify an orbit;

</p><dl>
<dt><strong>Inclination (i)</strong>
</dt><dd>angle between the plane of the Ecliptic and the plane of the
orbit.
</dd><dt><strong>Longitude of the Ascending Node (o)</strong>
</dt><dd>states the position in the orbit where the elliptical path
of the planet passes through the plane of the ecliptic, from
below the plane to above the plane.
</dd><dt><strong>Longitude of Perihelion (p)</strong>
</dt><dd>states the position in the orbit where the planet is closest
to
the Sun.
</dd><dt><strong>Mean distance (a)</strong>
</dt><dd>the value of the semi-major axis of the orbit - 
measured in Astronomical Units for the major planets.
</dd><dt><strong>Daily motion (n)</strong>
</dt><dd>states how far in degrees the planet moves in one (mean
solar) day. This figure can be used to find the mean anomaly of
the planet for a given number of days either side of the date of
the elements. The figures quoted in the Astronomical Almanac do
<em>not</em> tally with the period of the planet as calculated
by
applying Kepler's 3rd Law to the semi-major axis.
</dd><dt><strong>Eccentricity (e)</strong>
</dt><dd>eccentricity of the ellipse which describes the orbit
</dd><dt><strong>Mean Longitude (L)</strong>
</dt><dd>Position of the planet in the orbit on the date of the
elements.
</dd></dl>

<p>I use the osculating elements taken from page E3 of the
Astronomical Almanac for 1997. As explained in the previous
section, these elements are referred to the 'mean ecliptic and
equinox' of J2000.0, so that positions calculated from these
elements will show the correct relationship with the stars when
plotted on a J2000 star chart, apart from the effect of light
travel time. The osculating elements include the
effects of the other planets (perturbations) at the date 8th
August 1997, and will give less accurate positions the further
we go from that date. This has nothing to do with the
<em>coordinate system</em> we happen to want to use, the J2000
mean ecliptic and equinox.

<h2><a name="twig02a">Outline of steps in the
calculation</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p> The sections below deal with calculating the RA and DEC of a
planet from the osculating elements. As an example, I shall find
the position of Mars at 0h UT on the 21st of June 1997. The main
steps in the calculation are;

</p><ul>
<li>Finding the position of the planet in its orbit
    <ul>
    <li>Find the number of days since the date of the elements
    </li><li>Find the mean anomaly from the Mean Longitude and the
daily motion
    </li><li>Find the true anomaly using the Equation of Centre
    </li><li>Find the radius vector of the planet
    </li></ul>
</li><li>Refer that position to the Ecliptic - hence find the
heliocentric ecliptic coordinates of the planet
</li><li>Repeat most of above to find the heliocentric coordinates of
the Earth
</li><li>Transform the heliocentric coordinates to geocentric
coordinates by a change of origin
</li><li>Transform the geocentric ecliptic coordinates to geocentric
equatorial coordinates by a rotation about the X axis
</li><li>Calculate the RA and DEC and Earth - planet distance from 
the rectangular coordinates
</li></ul>

<p>I have used rectangular coordinates throughout, as most
people
with a science and engineering background will be more familiar
with the ideas of coordinate transformations acting on Cartesian
coordinates than with spherical trigonometry. Those who know
matrix algebra might feel happier recasting the calculations
below in matrix form [Duffett-Smith, section 31]. The method
shown here is <em>not</em> that used by Thomas Streete or Edmond
Halley!

</p><p>The method used here was adapted from Paul Schlyter's page
'How
to compute planetary positions' at

<h3><a name="twig03a">Number of days from date of
elements</a></h3>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>To find the number of days since the date of the osculating
elements (d), you can find the 'day number' (dele) of the
elements, and then the 'day number' you want the position for
(dpos). Then you just subtract,

</p><pre>d = dpos - dele</pre>

<p>
The 'day number' can be the Julian day, or the number of days
since the fundamental epoch J2000. I use the second alternative
as less precision is needed for the numbers!

</p><p>The following tables show the days from the beginning of the
year to the beginning of each month, and the days from J2000 to
the beginning of each year.

</p><pre>        Days to beginning of month

        Month   Normal year    Leap year

        Dec       334           335

        Days since J2000 to beginning of each year

                  Days
        1995    -1827.5
        1996    -1462.5
        1997    -1096.5
        1998     -731.5
        1999     -366.5
        2000       -1.5
        2001      364.5
        2002      729.5
        2003     1094.5
        2004     1459.5
        2005     1825.5
</pre>

<p>
we can find the day number corresponding to the date of the
elements (0h 20th August 1997) as follows;
</p><pre>        dele = 212 + 20 - 1096.5 = -864.5
</pre>

<p>
and the day number of the date we want the position for (0h 21st
June 1997) is;
</p><pre>        dpos = 151 + 21 - 1096.5 = -924.5
</pre>
so the number of days <em>after</em> the date of the elements is
<pre>         dpos  -  dele  =  d
        -924.5 - -864.5 = -60 days
</pre>
i.e. 60 days <em>before</em> the elements. You must take dates
before an epoch as negative in the calculations below.

<p>For fast moving planets such as Mercury and Mars, you need to
include
the time of day which you want the position for. Just add the
Universal Time in decimal hours divided by 24 to the day number
of your position (dele above);
</p><pre>      day fraction = (H + M/60)/24 
    
      H is hours UT
      M is minutes UT
</pre>

<h3><a name="twig03b">Finding the Mean Anomaly of the
planet</a></h3>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]
<p>
The Mean Anomaly of the planet is given by the very simple
formula;
</p><pre>        M = n * d + L - p 

        n is daily motion
        d is the number of days since the date of the elements
        L is the mean longitude
        p is the longitude of perihelion 

        M should be in range 0 to 360 degrees, add or subtract
          multiples of 360 to bring M into this range.
</pre>

<p>
For our case of Mars and -60 days since the date of the
elements;
</p><pre>        n = 0.5240613
        d = -60
        L = 262.42784
        p = 336.0882

        M = 0.5240613 * -60 + 262.42784 - 336.0882
          = -105.104038 + 360
          = 254.895962 
</pre>

<h3><a name="twig03c">Finding the true anomaly of the
planet</a></h3>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]
<p>
Kepler's second law states that the radius vector of the planet
sweeps out equal areas in equal times. This means that the
planet
must speed up and slow down in its orbit. The mean anomaly tells
us where the planet would be given mean motion in a circular
orbit of radius equal to the semimajor axis. We want the true
angle from the perihelion - known as the true anomaly.

</p><p> For this 'manual' calculation, I shall use an approximation
to the true anomaly known as the Equation of Centre. This
approximation takes the form of a power series in the
eccentricity and the sine of the mean anomaly. The Astronomical
Almanac (page E4) quotes the series as far as the third power of
the eccentricity. In our notation;

</p><pre>     v = M + 180/pi * [ (2 * e - e^3/4) * sin(M) 
                             + 5/4 * e^2 * sin(2*M)
                             + 13/12 * e^3 * sin(3*M) ]

         v is true anomaly
         M is mean anomaly
         e is eccentricity
         pi is 3.14159...

         e^3 means the third power of e. Note how the third
         power is involved the first term as well as the last.
</pre>

<p>
For our Mars position, we have
    
</p><pre>
    M = 254.895962 degrees
    e = 0.0934231

    v = 254.895962 + 57.29577951 * [ -0.180195 + 0.005489 +
    0.0006212 ]
      = 254.895962 - 9.974293328
      = 244.921657 degrees
</pre>

<p> As you can see, the correction is large for Mars, nearly 10
degrees. I usually do a rough check on the size of this
correction - find a rough value for <code>2 * e * sin(M)</code>
then multiply by 60. 

</p><p>
For more information about the true anomaly, see my page at;

</p><p><a href="http://www.stargazing.net/kepler/kepler.html">

</p><h3><a name="twig03d">Finding the radius vector of the
planet</a></h3>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]
<p>The distance from the planet to the focus of the ellipse is
given by a simple formula based on the geometry of the ellipse;

</p><pre>      r = a * (1 - e^2) / [1 + e * cos(v)]
  
          a is the semi-major axis
          e is the eccentricity
          v is the true anomaly

          the radius vector r will be in the same units as a
          a.u. in this case.
</pre>

In our Mars calculation we have;

<pre>      a = 1.5236365
      e = 0.0934231
      v = 244.921657
    
      r = 1.5236365 * (1 - 0.0934231^2) / [ 1 + 0.0934231 * cos
      (244.921657) ]
        = 1.57261067
</pre>

<h2><a name="twig04">Heliocentric coordinates of the
planet</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>Having found the true anomaly and the radius vector of the
planet, we can go on to find the position of the planet with
respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The formulas below are a
combination of 'resolving' to find components and rotations
around various axes to transform the coordinates to the Ecliptic
frame. We might expect the formulas to involve the inclination
of
the planet's orbit (i), and various angles within the plane of
the orbit, as well as the longitude of the ascending node (o).

</p><pre> 
    X = r * [cos(o) * cos(v + p - o) - sin(o) * sin(v + p - o) *
    cos(i)]
    Y = r * [sin(o) * cos(v + p - o) + cos(o) * sin(v + p - o) *
    cos(i)]
    Z = r * [sin(v + p - o) * sin(i)]

    r is radius vector
    v is true anomaly
    o is longitude of ascending node
    p is longitude of perihelion
    i is inclination of plane of orbit

    the quantity v + o - p is the angle of the planet measured
    in the plane of the orbit from the ascending node
</pre>

In the case of Mars we have;

<pre>    r = 1.57261067
    v = 244.921657
    o = 49.5664
    p = 336.0882
    i = 1.84992
    v + p - o = 531.443457 - 360 = 171.443457
 
    and I get the following rectangular coordinates;

    X = 1.57261067 * [ -0.64134752 - 0.11319000 ] = -1.18659376
    Y = 1.57261067 * [ -0.75268604 + 0.09644689 ] = -1.03200869
    Z = 1.57261067 * [  0.00480302 ]              =  0.00755328

    as a check, SQRT(X^2 + Y^2 + Z^2) should be same as r
    I get a difference in the 7th decimal place due to
    rounding.
</pre>

<h2><a name="twig05">Heliocentric coordinates of Earth</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>We must find the true anomaly and radius vector of the Earth
using the same method as for the planet. The calculations are
shown in a more compact form  - see if you can follow the logic.

</p><pre>    M = 0.9855796 * -60 + 328.40353 - 102.8517
      = 166.417054 degrees

    V = 166.417054 + 57.29577951 * [ 0.00784226 - 0.00015852 +
    0.00000328 ]
      = 166.417054 + 0.440433803
      = 166.8574877

        (note how small the difference between M and v is
        compared
         to the difference for Mars)

    r = 1.0000200 * (1 - 0.0166967^2) / [1 + 0.0166967 *
    cos(166.8574877)]
      = 1.01626505 a.u.
</pre>

<p>To find the heliocentric coordinates for Earth, we can make
some simplifications to the formulas as the inclination of the
Earth's orbit is very small. We have;

</p><pre>   Xe = r * cos(v + p)
   Ye = r * sin(v + p)
   Ze = 0

   r is radius vector of Earth
   v is true anomaly for Earth
   p is longitude of perihelion for Earth
</pre>

<p>
For the problem in hand we have;

</p><pre>   r = 1.01626505    a.u.
   v = 166.8574877   degs
   p = 102.8517      degs

   Xe = 1.01626505 * -0.0050756103 = -0.00515816
   Ye = 1.01626505 * -0.999987119  = -1.01625196
   Ze                              =  0
</pre> 

<h2><a name="twig06">Geocentric ecliptic coordinates of the
planet</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>Changing the origin of the coordinate system from the Sun to
the Earth is very easy, we just subtract the Earth's coordinates
from those of the planet;

</p><pre>   X' = X - Xe
   Y' = Y - Ye
   Z' = Z - Ze  
</pre>

<p>We then have the geocentric ecliptic coordinates of the
planet. For the case of Mars we have,

</p><pre>   X' = -1.18659376 - -0.00515816 = -1.18143560
   Y' = -1.03200869 - -1.01625196 = -0.01575673
   Z' =  0.00755328 - 0           =  0.00755328
</pre>

<h2><a name="twig07">Geocentric equatorial coordinates of the
planet</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>To change the coordinate system from geocentric ecliptic to
geocentric equatorial is just a matter of a rotation around the
X
axis by an angle equal to the 'obliquity of the Ecliptic. The X
axis points towards the 'First point of Aries', which is the
direction in space associated with the equinox. As we are using
elements referred to the equinox of J2000.0, we use the
obliquity
for that epoch, which is 23.439292 degrees.

the formulas are given below;

</p><pre>    Xq = X'
    Yq = Y' * cos(ec) - Z' * sin(ec)
    Zq = Y' * sin(ec) + Z' * cos(ec)

    Xq are the equatorial coordinates
    X' are the geocentric ecliptic coordinates      
    ec is the obliquity of the ecliptic 
</pre>

<p>For Mars, we have

</p><pre>    Xq = -1.18143560
    Yq = -0.01746127
    Zq = +0.00066224
</pre>

<p>
rectangular coordinates are not much use with star charts, so we
calculate the familiar right ascension and declination using the
formulas;

</p><pre>    alpha = arctan(Yq/Xq)
     
    If Xq is negative then add 180 degrees to alpha  
    If Xq is positive and Yq is negative then add 360 degrees to
    alpha

    alpha is usually expressed in hours, so divide by 15

    delta = arctan( Zq / SQRT(Xq^2 + Yq^2)) 

    distance = SQRT( Xq^2 + Yq^2 + Zq^2)          
</pre>

In the case of Mars on the 21st June 1997 we have

<pre>    alpha = arctan(-0.01746127/-1.18143560)
          = 0.84675309 + 180 = 180.84675309 /15
          = 12.05645 hrs

    delta = arctan(+0.00066224/ 1.39609497)
          = 0.02718 degs  

    distance = SQRT( -1.18143560^2 + -0.01746127^2 +
    +0.00066224^2) 
             = 1.18156481 a.u.      
</pre>

<p>These positions compare well with those from the
<code>QBASIC</code> program, which uses an iterative routine to
find the true anomaly. Differences in the heliocentric
coordinates of Mars are in the fourth decimal place. Differences
in the RA are five <em>arc</em> minutes and about 20 arc seconds
in
declination.

</p><h2><a name="twig08">QBASIC program</a></h2>

<p>
The very simple <code>QBASIC</code> program below will prompt
you
for the Year, Month, Day and Hour and Minute (UT) for which you
want the position, and a number representing the planet you wish
to calculate the position for. The program will then print

</p><ul>
<li>The number of days from J2000.0
</li><li>The heliocentric rectangular coordinates of the Earth
</li><li>The heliocentric rectangular coordinates of the planet
</li><li>The RA of the planet in hh.mm form
</li><li>The DEC of the planet in dd.mm form
</li><li>The distance of the planet from Earth in A.U.
</li></ul>

<p>I have used the <code>DEF FN</code> statements to define
functions. By
doing this the code will compile using the FirstBas shareware
compiler available from PowerBasic.

<h2><a name="twig10">Accuracy</a></h2>
[<a href="#twig00">Top</a>]

<p>The <code>QBASIC</code> program was modified to produce
positions for the major panets over a 20 year period centred on
the date of the osculating elements used. The resulting
positions
were saved to a file and loaded into a spreadsheet long with
values exported from Planeph 2.1, which was set to generate
positions referred to the 'mean ecliptic and equinox of
J2000.0'.

The Error was defined as 'value from osculating elements - value
from Planeph'. Remember that the program uses an accurate
iterative method for finding the true anomalies of both the
planet and Earth.

</p><p> The results are shown in the table below. I forgot that my
<code>QBASIC</code> program was rounding the RA and DEC figures
to three decimal places, so errors smaller than 2 seconds or
arcseconds could really be anywhere between 0 and 2
seconds/arcseconds!

<p>The longer period planets (beyond Jupiter) may show larger
errors for other choices of element date - the 20 year time span
here is only sampling part of a typical orbit, and Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune are strongly perturbed by Jupiter.

</p><p>With 'peak to mean ratios' like those in the table, you might
guess that a time series graph of error against position date
would show a complex behaviour, not a simple monotonic rise with
time from the date of the elements. Looking at the plots of
error
against decimal year from the date of the elements does indeed
show a complex periodic structure. Below are the plots for Mars.

</p><h3>Error time series graphs for Mars</h3>

<img src="Planet%20positions%20using%20elliptical%20orbits_files/oscmar1.gif" alt="graph of RA error against year from date of elements" height="334" width="565">

<p>
The main features of the RA error time series for Mars are
</p><ul>

<li>The curve is mostly flat, with narrow high 'peaks' which
recur after a period of about 2.2 years. The peaks are not quite
symmetrical about the date of the elements.

</li><li>The 'peaks' are negative for position dates before the date
of the elements, and positive for position dates after the date
of the elements.

</li><li>The 'peaks' start small, and grow in size as the position
date is further from the element date, apart from the last pair
of peaks. 

</li><li>The two peaks at the largest times from the date of the
elements (occuring at -8.87 and + 8.21 years) are slightly
smaller than the preceeding one (at -6.79 and + 6.02 years), so
the amplitude of the peaks may be periodic.

</li><li>The 'half width'
of the larger peaks seems to be constant at about 0.3 years. 

</li><li>The maximum error (including the peaks) is less than 1
minute
of time for position dates within 5 years of the element date.

</li></ul>

<img src="Planet%20positions%20using%20elliptical%20orbits_files/oscmar2.gif" alt="graph of DEC error against year from date of elements" height="334" width="565">

<p>
The main features of the DEC error time series for Mars are;
</p><ul>
<li>Error is mostly flat with 'peaks' like the RA graph.
</li><li>The peaks recur after a period of roughly 2.2 years, and the
peaks co-incide with the peaks in RA error.
</li><li>The peaks are more complex in structure, and are preceeded
by
smaller 'dips' - as if there is another periodic error term
causing 'destructive intereference'. The two peaks furthest from
the element date show this very clearly.
</li><li>The polarity of the peaks seems to change - as the position
date is set further ahead of the element date, the first two
peaks are small and negative in sign, then the next two are
large
and positive in sign. The pattern is the same but inverted for
position dates before the element date.
</li><li>The maximum error (including the peaks) is less than 5
minutes of arc for 5 years either side of the date of the
elements.
