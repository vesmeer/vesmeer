# Vesmeer
Welcome to the Vesmeer.com Space Simulator project.

# What is Vesmeer?
Vesmeer is a universe simulator built using THREE.js, running in a browser. At the moment, the software covers the major bodies of the solar system. Much more is to come...

### Things that should be worked on next
* Make sure planets' tilts are correct. At the moment, they are not correct for all planets.
* Add moons.
* Add Jupiter and Uranus rings.
* Add the ability to speed up and slow down time.
* Build a 3D object loader (obj format).
* Start working on internal API.
